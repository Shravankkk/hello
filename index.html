You seem like someone who gives off a chill, simple vibe...someone who enjoys a bit of rest, a little adventure, and good energy in between. Honestly, thats such a sweet mix. I have a feeling you would be really easy to talk to and even nicer to get to know. :)

Ohhh you used to draw? Thats lovely.  I used to draw a bit back in school too, nothing serious 😅... Maybe one day we can have a fun drawing challenge or something… just for fun, no judging 🤭
<br>
You didnt tell me what instantly makes you smile so im just gonna guess… maybee its something simple like making cool stuff with your hands, chilling in the garden, or those little cute moments while traveling. I love traveling too, so I hope im close 😛! 
<br>
I don't know how you'll take this.. but I just wanted to create something nice and say it and also Im looking for something real and long term. just hoping we can get to know each other better.
